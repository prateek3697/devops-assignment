# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline setup, containerization, deployment on a cloud platform, and automation to ensure high availability, scalability, and maintainability. The assignment meets core DevOps requirements and uses Docker for containerization, Jenkins for CI/CD, and Kubernetes for cloud deployment.

# Core Requirements

# 1. CI/CD Pipeline

* **Setup:**  A Jenkins CI/CD pipeline has been implemented to manage the continuous integration and continuous deployment processes.
* **Pipeline Stages:**
  * **Checkout:** Pulls the latest code from the repository.
  * **Build:** Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
  * **Authenticate with ECR:** Authenticates and pushes the Docker image to AWS ECR.
  * **Push Image:** Uploads the built Docker image to the container registry.
  * **Deploy:** Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Automated Testing:** Testing can be implemented in the build stage using Jest or Mocha to ensure code quality and reliability.
* **Notifications:** Jenkins notifications (email, Slack) can be configured to alert on build and deployment statuses.

# 2. Containerization

* **Dockerization:** The application is containerized using Docker to package all dependencies and environments consistently.
* **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile has been created to define the application environment, using NGINX as the base image to serve the static files.
* **Image Management:** Docker images are automatically tagged and stored in AWS ECR for easy versioning and distribution.
* **Docker Compose:** A **docker-compose.yml** file can be added if more services are required, to manage multiple containers.

# 3. Deployment to Cloud Platform

* **Cloud Platform:** The containerized application is deployed to Kubernetes, hosted on AWS, which offers flexibility and scalability.
* **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information (e.g., ECR credentials) is securely managed through Jenkins and AWS IAM roles.
* **Auto-scaling:** Kubernetes manages scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, handling fluctuating loads automatically.

# 4. High Availability and Load Balancing

* **Load Balancer:** A load balancer in Kubernetes distributes traffic across multiple pod instances, ensuring optimal performance.
* **Health Checks:** Configured liveness and readiness probes ensure only healthy containers are available for incoming traffic.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitoring and alerts can be set up using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch, to track application health and respond to incidents in real time.

# 5. Scripting and Automation
* **CI/CD Automation:** A Groovy script **(build_and_deploy.groovy)** in Jenkins automates the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Docker Build and Deployment Automation:** The pipeline script handles the Docker build, authentication, push to ECR, and deployment to Kubernetes with minimal manual intervention.
* **Documentation:** The script is written in a modular and maintainable format for ease of updates.


# Advanced Features

**1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

  * **IaC Implementation:** Terraform can be used to define and provision AWS resources, such as the Kubernetes cluster, ECR repository, and IAM roles, ensuring reproducibility and versioning of the infrastructure.

**2. Security and Compliance**

  * **Security Best Practices:** AWS IAM policies restrict access to ECR and Kubernetes resources, ensuring only authorized actions are permitted.

  * **CI/CD Security:** Secure credentials management in Jenkins, and controlled access to sensitive AWS resources through IAM.

**3. Disaster Recovery**

  * **Backup Strategy:** ECR and Kubernetes are configured with replication and backup policies to ensure data integrity.
  * **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Kubernetes is set up with autoscaling and automated redeployment, ensuring availability even in the event of a failure.

# Implementation Details

**1. CI/CD Pipeline**

  * **Pipeline Tool:** Jenkins is used for setting up the CI/CD pipeline.
  * **Stages:** The Jenkins pipeline has stages for code checkout, Docker image building, authentication with AWS ECR, pushing the image, and deploying it to Kubernetes.
  * **Testing Framework:** Future integration of Jest or Mocha in the build stage for testing.
  * **Notifications:** Integration with Slack or email for build and deployment notifications.

**2. Containerization**

  * **Dockerfile:** The Dockerfile in the jenkins folder defines the application environment with NGINX and copies the static files from the dist folder.
  * **Docker Image Management:** Images are tagged based on Jenkins build numbers and pushed to AWS ECR.
  * **Multi-Container Setup:** Docker Compose is available for setting up multi-container applications as the project scales.

**3. Deployment to Cloud Platform**

  * **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deployed to an AWS-hosted Kubernetes cluster, which provides high scalability and reliability.
  * **Environment Variables:** Managed securely in Kubernetes using Secrets and ConfigMaps.
  * **Auto-scaling:** Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) manage scaling based on resource usage.


**4. High Availability and Load Balancing**

  * **Load Balancing:** Traffic is distributed across Kubernetes pods using a load balancer service, ensuring seamless scaling.
  * **Monitoring and Logging:** Prometheus and Grafana or AWS CloudWatch can be configured for robust monitoring and alerting.
  * **Alerts:** Alerts set up for critical application metrics to respond quickly to issues.

**5. Scripting and Automation**

  * **Script Language:** Groovy is used for Jenkins pipeline scripts, with Bash for additional scripting needs.
  * **Documentation:** The pipeline scripts are documented for maintainability, making it easy to adapt or expand.


# Advanced Features

**1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
 * **Provision Infrastructure with IaC:**

   * Although this assignment primarily deploys a simple application, IaC principles could be applied using Terraform to manage the cloud infrastructure. For instance, creating an ECR repository, configuring the VPC, and setting up Kubernetes clusters could all be managed via IaC.
   * This would allow the infrastructure setup to be version-controlled and reproducible, making it easy to manage changes and deploy consistently across different environments.
* **Versioned Infrastructure:**

  * By using Terraform with a Git repository, every change to the infrastructure configuration would be versioned, which allows for easy rollback, auditing, and collaboration across the team.
  * The Dockerfile itself is an IaC tool defining the environment setup for the application, ensuring consistent builds.

**2. Security and Compliance**
   * **CI/CD Security Best Practices:**

     * The CI/CD pipeline includes secure practices, such as:
        * **IAM and Credentials Management:** AWS credentials are stored securely within Jenkins or GitHub, accessed through environment variables rather than hardcoding, which enhances security.
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Only the required permissions for ECR and Kubernetes are granted to the CI/CD user in AWS IAM.
   * **Containerization Security:**

        * The Dockerfile ensures a **minimal image** by using **nginx:alpine**, which reduces vulnerabilities associated with larger base images.
        * In a real-world setup, additional security could be added by using tools like Docker Bench for Security or Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
   * **Deployment Security:**

     * Kubernetes secrets (for sensitive environment variables and keys) are securely configured, ensuring that critical information like database credentials or API keys is never exposed.
     * **TLS/SSL** could be implemented for secure communication to and from the NGINX server if dealing with real production traffic.


**3. Disaster Recovery**
   * **Disaster Recovery Plan:**

     * A disaster recovery (DR) plan would involve taking regular backups of both the Docker images (to restore application state) and any persistent data storage.
     * **ECR Image Backup:** The Docker image pushed to ECR serves as an artifact that can be redeployed to bring the application back to its last working state.
   * **Data Backups and Restoration:**

     * Since the application data resides in Docker, regular backups of application data (if there were a database or persistent storage) could be automated using cloud backup solutions or custom scripts.
     * Kubernetes Deployment Configurations: In case of a disaster, deployment configurations stored in YAML files or IaC scripts ensure a quick and reliable restoration of the application state.
